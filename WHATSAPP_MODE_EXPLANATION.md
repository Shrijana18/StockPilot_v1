# WhatsApp Business - How It Works

## Current Setup: Direct Link Mode ✅

You've successfully enabled WhatsApp using **Direct Link Mode**. Here's how it works:

### How Direct Link Works

1. **Order Status Updates:**
   - When you change an order status (e.g., mark as "Delivered")
   - System creates a WhatsApp Web link with pre-filled message
   - WhatsApp Web opens in a new tab
   - Message is ready - you just click "Send"
   - ✅ Works perfectly for small to medium volumes

2. **Stock Reminders:**
   - You select products and retailers
   - Click "Send Reminders"
   - For each retailer, WhatsApp Web opens with the reminder message
   - You click "Send" for each one
   - ✅ Great for personalized reminders

3. **Promotional Broadcasts:**
   - You create an offer and select retailers
   - Click "Send to X Retailers"
   - WhatsApp Web opens for each retailer
   - You send each message manually
   - ✅ Perfect for targeted promotions

### Pros of Direct Link Mode:
- ✅ **Free** - No API costs
- ✅ **Instant Setup** - Works immediately
- ✅ **No Technical Knowledge** - Just click and send
- ✅ **Works for Everyone** - No API approval needed
- ✅ **Personal Touch** - You see each message before sending

### Cons of Direct Link Mode:

- ⚠️ **Not Fully Automated** - Can't send 100+ messages automatically
- ⚠️ **Time Consuming** - For bulk sends, takes more time
