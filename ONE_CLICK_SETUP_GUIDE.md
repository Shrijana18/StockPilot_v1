# One-Click WhatsApp Setup - User Guide

## 🚀 Super Simple Setup

We've made WhatsApp setup **incredibly easy** - just one click and you're done!

## How It Works

### For Users (One Click)
1. Go to **Profile Settings** → **WhatsApp Business**
2. Click the big **"Enable WhatsApp (One Click)"** button
3. Done! ✅

That's it! No API keys, no technical setup, nothing complicated.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you click "Enable WhatsApp":
- ✅ Automatically enables WhatsApp notifications
- ✅ Sets up "Direct Link" mode (no API needed)
- ✅ Configures all settings with smart defaults
- ✅ Marks as verified immediately
- ✅ Saves everything to your profile

### How Direct Link Works

Instead of complex API setup, we use WhatsApp Web links:
- When you send a notification, it opens WhatsApp Web
- The message is pre-filled and ready to send
- You just click "Send" - that's it!

**Example:**
- You mark an order as "Delivered"
- System creates a WhatsApp link with the message
- WhatsApp opens with: "✅ Order #12345 has been delivered!"
- You click send - done!

## Features You Get

Once enabled, you automatically get:

1. **Order Status Updates** 📦
   - Automatic notifications when orders change status
   - Packed, Shipped, Delivered updates

2. **Stock Reminders** 📊
   - Send reminders to retailers about low stock
   - Bulk selection of products and retailers

3. **Promotional Broadcasts** 🎉
   - Send offers to multiple retailers at once
   - Customizable messages

4. **Delivery Tracking** 🚚
   - Automatic tracking updates (when courier integrated)

## Advanced Setup (Optional)

If you want automated sending (no manual click), you can upgrade to:
- **Meta WhatsApp Business API** - Official API
- **Twilio WhatsApp API** - Third-party provider

But for most users, **Direct Link is perfect** - it's free, instant, and works immediately!

## Troubleshooting
