# Production Deployment Checklist

## Issues Fixed for Production

### 1. **Production Environment Detection**
- Added `IS_PRODUCTION` flag to detect production environment
- Added production-specific error handling and logging

### 2. **Navigation Fallback**
- Added `window.location.href` fallback for production
- React Router navigation with 1-second timeout fallback
- Works for both email/password and Google sign-in

### 3. **Firebase Configuration**
- Added production-specific error handling
- Added global error handlers for unhandled promise rejections
- Added Firebase auth state change error handling

### 4. **Build Optimization**
- Added manual chunk splitting for better loading
- Disabled sourcemaps for production
- Added proper minification

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Build the Application**
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. **Deploy to flypnow.com**
- Upload the `dist` folder contents to your web server
- Ensure all files are uploaded correctly

### 3. **Verify Firebase Configuration**
- Check that Firebase project settings allow your domain
- Verify CORS settings in Firebase Console
- Check that all Firebase services are enabled

### 4. **Test the Application**
- Test login with email/password
- Test Google sign-in
- Verify navigation to correct dashboards
- Check browser console for any errors

## Common Production Issues

### 1. **CORS Issues**
- Make sure your domain is added to Firebase authorized domains
- Check Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains

### 2. **Firebase Rules**
- Ensure Firestore rules allow read access to user documents
- Check that the user can read their own business document

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
- Check that Firebase configuration is correct

### 4. **Build Issues**
- Clear browser cache after deployment
- Check that all assets are loading correctly
- Verify that the build output is complete

## Debugging Production Issues

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
- Look for Firebase errors
- Check for navigation errors
- Look for authentication errors

### 2. **Check Network Tab**
- Verify Firebase requests are successful
- Check for CORS errors
- Look for failed requests

### 3. **Check Firebase Console**
- Look for authentication errors
- Check Firestore read/write errors
- Verify user permissions

## Expected Behavior

### 1. **Login Flow**
1. User enters credentials
2. Firebase authenticates user
3. User data is fetched from Firestore
4. Role is detected and normalized
5. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard
6. If React Router fails, window.location fallback activates

### 2. **Console Logs**
- `[Login] Production environment detected`
- `[Firebase] Production environment detected`
- `[AuthContext] Production environment - Firebase user: [user-id]`
- `[Login] Redirecting to [role] dashboard`
- `[Login] React Router navigation failed, using window.location fallback` (if needed)

## Troubleshooting

If login still doesn't work in production:

1. **Check Firebase Console** for authentication errors
2. **Check Firestore Rules** for permission errors
3. **Check Browser Console** for JavaScript errors
4. **Check Network Tab** for failed requests
5. **Verify Domain** is added to Firebase authorized domains
6. **Clear Browser Cache** and try again
